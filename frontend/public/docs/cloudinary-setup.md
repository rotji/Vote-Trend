## ⚙️ Step 3: Configure Backend Environment

1. Open `backend/.env` file
2. Replace the Cloudinary placeholders with your real values:

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_actual_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_actual_api_secret
```

**Example:**

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=vote-trend-app
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=123456789012345
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=abcdef123456789secretkey
```

## 🎯 Step 4: Test Image Upload

1. Start your backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Start your frontend:

   npm run dev
   ```

3. Go to **Submit Topic** page
4. Try uploading a real image (e.g., photo of Trump, Messi, etc.)
5. ✅ Success: Image should upload to Cloudinary and display immediately

## 🏗️ Step 5: Database Schema Update

If you get database errors, you may need to add the `image_url` column to your polls table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE polls ADD COLUMN image_url VARCHAR(500);
```

---

## 📁 Step 6: Cloudinary Folder Structure

Your images will be automatically organized in Cloudinary:

```

    🖼️ poll_1635789456_messi.jpg

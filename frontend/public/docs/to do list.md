✅ Great! Here’s the **To-Do List for the entire project**, starting with the **Stacks Ascend requirements**, then grouped into **Simple → Medium → Complex** tasks so you know exactly what to do step by step.

---

# ✅ PHASE 1: ASCEND PROGRAM REQUIREMENT CHECKLIST (TOP PRIORITY)

These are the core things the Ascend program expects:

### ✅ A. Blockchain & Smart Contracts (Required)

* [ ] Use **Clarity smart contracts** extensively
* [ ] Deploy contracts to **Stacks Testnet or Mainnet**
* [ ] Include multiple contract functions (polls, votes, admin, sync, etc.)
* [ ] Make votes or poll logic interact with the blockchain

### ✅ B. Stacks.js Frontend Integration (Required)

* [ ] Use `@stacks/connect` (wallet login)
* [ ] Use `@stacks/transactions` (calling contracts)
* [ ] Use `@stacks/blockchain-api-client` (fetch chain state)
* [ ] Use `@stacks/storage` (optional for Gaia/metadata)

### ✅ C. Data Flow (Hybrid Model)

* [ ] Votes saved in PostgreSQL & MongoDB
* [ ] Oracle pushes actions to smart contracts
* [ ] Smart contracts verified via frontend using Stacks.js

✅ Once these are clear, we can structure development in phases.

---

# ✅ PHASE 2: SIMPLE TASKS (Foundational Setup)

### ✅ 1. Create Monorepo Structure

```
vote-trend/
  frontend/
  backend/
  smart-contracts/
  oracle/
```

### ✅ 2. Initialize Frontend

* [ ] Setup Vite + React + TypeScript
* [ ] Setup CSS Modules
* [ ] Install Stacks.js packages

### ✅ 3. Initialize Backend

* [ ] Setup Node + Express + TypeScript
* [ ] Setup dotenv
* [ ] Create base folder structure
* [ ] Connect to PostgreSQL
* [ ] Connect to MongoDB

### ✅ 4. Setup Cloudinary

* [ ] Install SDK
* [ ] Add config file
* [ ] Prepare upload helper

---

# ✅ PHASE 3: MEDIUM TASKS (Core App Without Blockchain)

### ✅ 1. User System

* [ ] Signup/Login with email, phone, or Google
* [ ] JWT / Session handling
* [ ] User roles: admin, user

### ✅ 2. Poll Management (Backend & DB)

* [ ] Create poll model (PostgreSQL)
* [ ] Store topics & images (MongoDB + Cloudinary)
* [ ] Admin routes: create/update/delete/approve
* [ ] User-submitted topics pending admin approval

### ✅ 3. Voting System (Web2)

* [ ] Create vote API endpoint
* [ ] Prevent duplicate votes
* [ ] Real-time vote updates via WebSockets or polling
* [ ] Save votes in PostgreSQL

### ✅ 4. Frontend UI (Basic)

* [ ] Pages: Home, Poll List, Poll Details, Login
* [ ] Components: VoteCard, VoteButton, ResultsPanel
* [ ] Topic submission form

---

# ✅ PHASE 4: COMPLEX TASKS (Web3 + Blockchain Integration)

### ✅ 1. Smart Contracts (Clarity)

* [ ] Setup Clarinet project in `smart-contracts/`
* [ ] Contract 1: PollManager (create polls)
* [ ] Contract 2: VoteRegistry (record votes)
* [ ] Contract 3: AdminControl (permissions)
* [ ] Contract tests
* [ ] Deployment script

### ✅ 2. Stacks.js Integration (Frontend)

* [ ] Wallet login with `@stacks/connect`
* [ ] Show user’s Stacks address
* [ ] Transaction calls for on-chain voting
* [ ] Display on-chain poll/vote data

### ✅ 3. Oracle Layer

* [ ] Initialize Node service in `/oracle`
* [ ] Listen to backend events (poll creation, votes)
* [ ] Forward relevant data to blockchain
* [ ] Handle failures/retries

### ✅ 4. Hybrid Vote Sync

* [ ] Store vote in PostgreSQL
* [ ] Oracle sends vote to Clarity
* [ ] Frontend reads from both DB + blockchain

---

# ✅ PHASE 5: ADVANCED / PRODUCTION TASKS

* [ ] Real-time result dashboard
* [ ] Token incentives (optional)
* [ ] Analytics + leaderboard
* [ ] Admin dashboard
* [ ] Smart contract versioning
* [ ] Testnet deployment
* [ ] Test users with Hiro Wallet

# ✅ YOUR NEXT STEP:

Tell me where you want to begin:

1️⃣ **Convert To-Do List into a Trello/Jira/Notion format**
2️⃣ **Start with PHASE 2 (Simple setup tasks)**
3️⃣ **Start with PHASE 3 (User + poll system)**
4️⃣ **Jump into blockchain (PHASE 4)**

Just say: **“Let’s start with X”** and I’ll begin immediately.

Here’s a **clear, non-technical explanation** of your platform and the technologies it uses, written in plain English — like something you can include in a proposal, pitch, or program application.

---

## ✅ Overview of the Platform

The platform is a web application where people **vote on trending topics and stories** in real time. These topics come from different areas such as:

* Sports
* Politics
* Entertainment
* Health
* Education
* Social issues, etc.

Admins (you and your team) can create polls, and users can also suggest poll ideas for approval. Voting options depend on the topic — they could be:

* Multiple choice (e.g., Ronaldo, Messi, Others)
* Yes/No (e.g., Do you support this policy?)
* Opinion-based options

Every vote updates the results immediately, and users can see the changes in real time.

Polls can also include **real images** of the people or topics being voted on — like photos of footballers or public figures.

---

## ✅ What Makes the Platform Special

Your platform does not just collect votes—it mixes **traditional technology** with **blockchain technology** to make everything:

* Transparent
* Secure
* Real-time
* Easy to use
* Difficult to manipulate

Users must log in with:

* Their email, phone number, or Google account
* Or their Stacks blockchain wallet

No anonymous voting.

---

## ✅ Technologies Involved (Explained in Simple English)

Here’s the list of all technologies, explained without technical jargon:

### ✅ 1. **Frontend (User Interface)**

This is what people see and use on their phone or laptop.

* **Vite + React + TypeScript**
  These are modern tools used to build fast and smooth websites. They help create pages where users:

  * Log in
  * Vote
  * See results live
  * Submit topic ideas
  * View images and poll details

* **CSS Modules**
  This simply controls the styling (colors, layouts, spacing) of the website.

---

### ✅ 2. Backend (Server & Logic)

This is where the core processing happens behind the scenes.

* **Node.js + Express + TypeScript**
  These handle:

  * User accounts
  * Topic and poll creation
  * Approvals by admins
  * Saving vote data
  * Connecting to databases
  * Managing real-time updates

---

### ✅ 3. Databases (Storing Information)

You’re using a **hybrid system** with two databases:

* **PostgreSQL**
  This stores structured data like:

  * Polls
  * User profiles
  * Vote counts
  * Audit logs

* **MongoDB**
  This stores flexible or unstructured content like:

  * User-submitted topics
  * Poll images
  * Comments or descriptions

---

### ✅ 4. Images & Media

* **Cloudinary** will store and deliver images used in polls (e.g., photos of Messi, Trump, etc.).

---

### ✅ 5. Blockchain Layer (Web3 Integration)

This is required for the Stacks Ascend program.

* **Stacks.js**
  This library connects the website to the Stacks blockchain. It lets users:

  * Log in with a blockchain wallet
  * Sign and send blockchain transactions
  * View on-chain data

* **Clarity Smart Contracts**
  These are programs stored on the blockchain. They handle:

  * On-chain vote records
  * Poll approvals
  * Topic submissions
  * Verification and transparency

Your platform will use a **hybrid model** — votes are saved in the regular database **and** recorded on the blockchain to ensure trust and transparency.

---

### ✅ 6. Oracle Layer

Since not everything happens directly on the blockchain, an **oracle** will act as a bridge between the app and the Clarity contracts.

The oracle will:

* Take real-time actions happening in the app (votes, approvals, new polls)
* Send the relevant ones to the Clarity contracts for recording on-chain
* Help combine Web2 (normal web) with Web3 (blockchain)

This makes the platform powerful and compliant with the Ascend program’s expectations.

---

## ✅ Final Summary (One Sentence)

This platform is a modern, secure, and real-time voting app that combines traditional web technology (React, Node, SQL, NoSQL) with blockchain technology (Stacks.js, Clarity smart contracts, and an oracle system) to ensure transparency, speed, user identity, and real-time results across multiple categories.

Great — we’ll use **Option A (Monorepo Structure)** ✅
Here’s the **complete technical folder structure** based on all the requirements we discussed.

# ✅ HOW EACH PART WORKS TOGETHER

### 🔹 1. Frontend (React + Stacks.js)

* Users vote, log in, see live results
* Uses Stacks.js for:

  * Wallet login
  * Calling smart contracts
  * Viewing on-chain vote counts

### 🔹 2. Backend (Node + Express)

* Handles:

  * User accounts (email/phone/google login)
  * Poll creation & approvals
  * Vote storage in PostgreSQL
  * Topics & media in MongoDB
  * Cloudinary for images

### 🔹 3. Smart Contracts (Clarity)

* Manages:

  * Poll creation on-chain
  * Vote recording on-chain
  * Admin roles
  * Result retrieval

### 🔹 4. Oracle Layer

* Syncs backend events with blockchain
* Example:
  ✅ When someone votes → Save to DB → Oracle forwards it to Clarity

### 🔹 5. Dual Databases

✅ PostgreSQL → Users, polls, votes
✅ MongoDB → Media, topics, descriptions
